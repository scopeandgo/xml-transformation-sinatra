Looking at this LinkedIn post generator project, it's quite focused with a single primary user (the consultant) but could potentially have different roles based on content creation and system maintenance. Since it's a web application, we should also consider technical support even if it's minimal.

<user>
<name>ContentCreator</name>
<primary_goal>Generate engaging LinkedIn posts about Ruby on Rails topics quickly and efficiently with minimal manual editing required</primary_goal>
</user>

<user>
<name>SystemAdministrator</name>
<primary_goal>Ensure the web application remains operational and performs content generation tasks reliably</primary_goal>
</user>

<user>
<name>ContentReviewer</name>
<primary_goal>Review and approve generated content to ensure it maintains professional standards and technical accuracy before posting to LinkedIn</primary_goal>
</user>

These roles represent the key stakeholders in this system, even though they might all be the same person (the consultant) wearing different hats. The ContentCreator is the primary role, focusing on the day-to-day usage of generating posts. The SystemAdministrator role is important even in a simple system to ensure functionality. The ContentReviewer role is crucial for maintaining quality control, even if it's the consultant reviewing their own generated content. I've kept the role list minimal given the project's scope explicitly mentions it's for a solo consultant.
