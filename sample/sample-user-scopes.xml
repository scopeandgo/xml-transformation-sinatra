I'll analyze each user role and define clear boundaries for their permissions and limitations. Given this is a solo consultant tool, the permissions need to be practical while maintaining system integrity. I'll focus on essential functionalities that align with the minimal viable product approach while ensuring proper system usage and content quality.

<user>
<name>ContentCreator</name>
<must>must be able to input topic ideas or keywords for post generation</must>
<must>must be able to generate new posts from the web interface</must>
<must>must be able to copy generated content to clipboard</must>
<must>must be able to regenerate content if not satisfied with results</must>
<must>must be able to specify post length or format preferences</must>
<mustnot>must not be able to modify the generation algorithm</mustnot>
<mustnot>must not be able to access system configuration settings</mustnot>
<mustnot>must not be able to access other users' generated content (if system expands)</mustnot>
</user>

<user>
<name>SystemAdministrator</name>
<must>must be able to access and modify system configuration settings</must>
<must>must be able to monitor system performance and errors</must>
<must>must be able to restart the generation service if needed</must>
<must>must be able to update content generation parameters</must>
<mustnot>must not be able to access generated content without proper authorization</mustnot>
<mustnot>must not be able to modify individual generated posts</mustnot>
</user>

<user>
<name>ContentReviewer</name>
<must>must be able to view generated content before publication</must>
<must>must be able to approve or reject generated content</must>
<must>must be able to add notes or feedback for revision</must>
<must>must be able to track approved vs rejected content</must>
<mustnot>must not be able to modify system settings</mustnot>
<mustnot>must not be able to generate new content directly</mustnot>
<mustnot>must not be able to bypass the review process</mustnot>
</user>

<final_thoughts>
These scope definitions are appropriate because they:
1. Maintain clear separation of concerns between content creation, system administration, and content review
2. Protect system integrity while enabling necessary functionality
3. Support the solo consultant use case while allowing for potential future expansion
4. Focus on the core functionality of content generation and quality control
5. Align with the minimal viable product approach while ensuring proper system usage
