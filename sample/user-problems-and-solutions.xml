<thinking>Based on the provided context, I'll analyze the problems and solutions for each relevant user of the salon booking system.</thinking>

<problem_for_users>
<user>SalonCustomer</user>
<problem>Salon customers currently struggle with the limitations of traditional booking methods. They must call during business hours, often waiting on hold while staff assists in-person clients. They face difficulties getting basic pricing information, modifying appointments, or making after-hours bookings. This leads to frustration and wasted time for customers who simply want to manage their hair appointments efficiently.</problem>

<user>Hairdresser</user>
<problem>Hairdressers face constant interruptions to their work when they need to check their schedules, confirm appointments, or handle booking changes. They lack a clear, real-time view of their upcoming appointments and have no efficient way to manage their schedule while working with clients. This impacts their productivity and the quality of service they can provide to clients in the salon.</problem>

<user>SalonManager</user>
<problem>Salon managers struggle with overseeing the booking process, often dealing with scheduling conflicts, miscommunications, and the challenge of maintaining consistent booking rules across all staff members. They lack centralized control over the scheduling system and have difficulty ensuring proper resource allocation throughout the salon.</problem>

<user>BackupReceptionist</user>
<problem>Backup receptionists face the challenging task of handling complex booking situations that fall outside standard procedures, while also needing to quickly understand the context of any booking issues that arise. They must juggle emergency schedule changes and exceptional cases without having immediate access to complete booking histories or customer information.</problem>

<user>SystemAdministrator</user>
<problem>System administrators face the complex challenge of maintaining a mission-critical booking system that must operate 24/7. They need to ensure seamless integration between multiple technologies, maintain system security, and quickly resolve any technical issues that could disrupt the booking process. They also must manage system updates and maintenance without disrupting the salon's operations.</problem>
